# Free Tier basic CDK config

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

Before using this you need to set up `aws cli` and `aws cdk` for your command line

## Useful commands

* `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
* `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
* `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests


* `cdk ls` - lists the stacks 
* `cdk deploy --all` - deploys everything
